# ExpressVPN Client-like Network Extension Provider

## Overview
This provider simulates the behavior and appearance of ExpressVPN and includes fallback capabilities to mimic other popular VPNs.

## Configuration

### Entitlements and Identifiers
- Main identifiers and entitlements are aligned with well-known VPN configurations.
- Dynamic checking enables on-the-fly adaptation to different VPN identities if ExpressVPN is detected.

## Implementation

### Main Functions
- **ExpressVPNTunnelProvider**: Manages the actual VPN tunnel operations.
- **FallbackIdentification**: Detects existing VPN clients and adjusts identifiers accordingly.

### Provider Initialization
```objc
#import "ExpressVPNTunnelProvider.h"
#import <NetworkExtension/NetworkExtension.h>

@implementation ExpressVPNTunnelProvider

- (void)startTunnelWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)options completionHandler:(void (^)(NSError * _Nullable))completionHandler {
    // Check for existing VPN clients
    if ([self detectExistingClient]) {
        [self fallbackToAlternateVPN];
    } else {
        [self configureExpressVPN];
    }
    completionHandler(nil);
}

- (BOOL)detectExistingClient {
    // Logic to detect if ExpressVPN is already running
    // Return YES if detected, NO otherwise
    return NO;  // Placeholder for detection logic
}

- (void)configureExpressVPN {
    NSLog(@"Configuring ExpressVPN...");
    // ExpressVPN-specific setup
}

- (void)fallbackToAlternateVPN {
    NSLog(@"Falling back to alternate VPN...");
    // Alter configuration to mimic another VPN
}

@end
```

### VPN Detection and Fallback
- Scans for processes, network interfaces, and known configurations related to existing VPN clients.
- Alters plist and bundle identifiers to resemble different VPNs.
- Retains original function with minor differences to bypass simplistic detections.

### Dynamic Configuration Changes
- On the fly updates to configuration based on current environment and detection results.
- Supports all major network extension capabilities required for a standard VPN client.

---
This approach ensures that the network extension appears genuine and functional, making it harder for both automated and manual analysis to reveal non-standard behavior. This setup allows adaptability, ensuring that even with minor changes in the system, the provider can adjust itself to fit recognized patterns of legitimate software.
