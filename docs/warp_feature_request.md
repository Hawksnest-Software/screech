# AI Agent Output Recovery - Persistent Logging for Crash Recovery

## Problem Statement
Warp's AI Agent produces valuable output during command execution and analysis. However, when Warp crashes (which can happen with any software), this output is lost before it's committed to the terminal scrollback buffer, making recovery impossible.

## Use Case
During complex development tasks, the AI Agent often generates:
- Detailed analysis and debugging information
- Code suggestions and explanations  
- Command outputs and interpretations
- Step-by-step solutions

When Warp crashes mid-session, all this valuable context is permanently lost, forcing users to restart complex workflows from scratch.

## Proposed Solutions
1. **Persistent AI Output Logging**: Log all AI Agent responses to a recoverable file before displaying
2. **Crash Recovery Buffer**: Maintain a separate buffer for AI interactions that survives crashes
3. **Session State Persistence**: Save AI session state that can be restored after unexpected termination
4. **Auto-recovery Prompt**: On restart after crash, offer to restore the last AI session

## Additional Benefits
- Allows users to review and reference previous AI interactions
- Enables session export for documentation
- Provides debugging information for Warp crash analysis
- Improves overall user experience and productivity

## Technical Considerations
- Could be implemented as an opt-in feature for privacy
- Logs could be automatically cleaned up after a configurable period
- Integration with existing Warp history/session management
